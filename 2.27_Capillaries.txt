Capillaries:
    - Adaptations:
        - one cell thick wall => short diffusion distances
        - highly branched beds
        - continious supply of fresh blood => maintains conc. gradient
        - one cell thick lumen

Lumen => interior space of cavity (blood vessel)

Tissue fluid = a fluid found in the spaces between cells and blood capillaries
within tissues and organs

Lymph => extra fluid that drains from cells and tissues

Vascular shunt => redirection of blood flow

The amount of water forced out of the capillaries to form tissue fluid, must all
be absorbed. If not, water balance in the body will be affected and the tissues will swell up.

Lymph from all lymph vessels around the body collects and returns to the blood, near the heart
