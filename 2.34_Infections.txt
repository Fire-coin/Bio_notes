Infection => pathogen invades body

Epidermis => waxy and impermeable to water and pathogens

Chemical secrations:
    - HCl in stomach
    - Lysozyne in tears
    - Bactericidal wax in ears

Physical defences:
    - Wounded skin => platelets release thrombin that convers fibrinogen into fibrin

Pathogens have Antigens on hteir cell curface, which is recognised and destroyed
by phagocytes and antibodies

Phagocytes are attracted to woulnds by chemical signals
When many phagocytes are at one place in lungs, they may become disorganised =>
emphysema

Emphysema => phagocytes destroy lung tissue
