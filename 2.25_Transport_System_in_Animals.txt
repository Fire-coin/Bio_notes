All vertabrates have blood system which contains four parts:
    - A medium (the fluid to flow) - blood
    - A system of tubes (to carry fluid) - arteries and veins
    - A pump - heart
    Sites of exchange - capillaries

Blood is circulatory medium composed of 2 parts:
    - Plasma (55%) 
    - Cells (45%)

Red blood cells (erythrocytes):
    -Function => transport oxygen
    -Adaptation => no nucleus = more heamoglobin; bi-concave shape = large surf. area

Phagocytes => irregular shape of nucleus; engulfs pathogens

Lymphocytes => produce antibodies

Platelets => enable blood clotting
