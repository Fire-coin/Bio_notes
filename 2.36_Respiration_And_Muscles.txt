Energy conversions => photosynthesis & respiration

Aerobic respiration => is the oxidation of food molecules (eg. glucose) involving enzymes

ATP => Adenosine triphosphate


Muscles => collection of very long muscle fibres, that all shorten at the same time

For earobic respiration:
    - respiration system => takes in the oxygen
    - digestive system => digests & absorbs the glucose
    - circulatory system => delivers reactants to muscles

Anaerobic Respiration => when not enough energy is produced by aerobic,
muscles release by themselves from food

Lactic acid:
    - half of glucose molecule
    - leading to fatigue
    - oxidised to pyruvate + extra oxygen needed

Anaerobic in yeast => ethanol + CO2

Cell respiration formula:
    - glucose + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water + ATP
    - C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP
    - oxygen consumption => measured by respirometer
    - CO2 release => limewater || hydrogencarbonate indicator
