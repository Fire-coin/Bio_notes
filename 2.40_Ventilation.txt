Breathing => a set of muscular movements allowing ventilation
Breathing requires:
    - intercostal muscles & diaphragm
    - properties of pleural membranes, surrounding the lungs

Pleural membranes are sticky, ensuring that lung movement follows chest

Breathing in:
    - volume of chest cavity increases
    - volume of lungs increases
    - pressure inside the lungs decreases

Insipiration:
    - External intercostal muscles contract => rib cage moves upwards and outwards
    - Diaphragm moves down and flattens
    - Lungs volume increase and pressure falls 

Expiration:
    - External intercostal muscles relax => rib cage falls down and inwards
    - Diaphragm relaxes => return to dome shape
    - Lungs volume decrease and pressure increases

Asthma:
    treatment => bronchodilator (relaxes muscles)

Effieciency of lungs:
    - measured with spirometer on spirogram

Exercise and breathing:
    - increased breath rate
    - increased Tidal volume (air / breath)
    - Deeper & faster heartbeat and breathing
