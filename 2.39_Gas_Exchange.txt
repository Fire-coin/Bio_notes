Ideal respiratory surface:
    - is thin => for shorter diffusion distances
    - large surface area => for effiecent diffusion
    - is moist => gasses can dissolve to diffuse
    - has rich supply of capillaries => for transport of gasses

Gas exchange in humans:
    - a set of tubes => highly branched
    - respiratory surface => membrane lining the alveoli
    - blood supply
    - ventilation system => good air flow over surfaces

Larynx => voice cords
Trachea => main pipe toward lungs; has C-shaped rings from Cartilage
Bronchus => first branch from the trachea

Bronchial tree is lined by ciliated epithelia cells and goblet cells forming mucous membrane
Goblet cells => produce sticky mucus 
Cilia => fine hair like structures to carry mucus

CO2 dissolves as hydrogencarbonate ions to prevent lowering pH
O2 carried as Oxyheamoglobin to not affect water balance
