Antibody => protein produced by B-lymphocytes; Y-shaped

Pathogens are destroyed by:
    - engulfed by phagocytes
    - T-lymphocytes burst Pathogen's membranes / infected host cell
    - some antibodies destroy pathogen's cell walls/membranes

Lymphocytes:
    - found in blood and in lymph nodes
    - large nucleus
    - B-cells produce antibodies when stimulated (contact with pathogen)

Antigens:
    - Protein / carbohydrate on surface of pathogen
    - Provoke immune system of host

Immunity:
    - Active:
        - Antibodies made
        - Memory cells
        - Long term
        - Infected by pathogen / vaccine with weakened pathogen
    - Passive:
        - Antibodies given
        - no memory cells
        - short term
        - through breast milk / antibodies in serum from lab animals
