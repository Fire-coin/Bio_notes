The circulatory system => is a system of blood vessels, with a pump and valves

Blood vessels:
    Arteries => blood flows away from the heart
    Veins => blood flows towards the heart
    Capillaries => tiny vessels linking arteries and veins
    Main vessels:
        Aorta => exiting the heart
        Vena Cava => entering the heart

Double circulatory system:
    - The blood passes twice through the heart to complete curcuit of the body
    Advantages:
        - Allows greater bodies
        - More blood is oxygeneted

The heart:
    - has 4 chambers
    - Septum => separates oxygeneted and deoxygeneted blood
    - Blood leaves ventricles at high pressure (5x more in left)
    - Systemic circuit:
        - From aorta blood goes to: Hepatic and Renal 
        and other arteries to other body parts
        - They return in coresponding vein back to the Vena Cava
