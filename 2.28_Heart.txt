Right side => deoxygeneted blood
Left side => oxygeneted blood (5x pressure)

Valves:
    - Atrioventricular valves => between atria and ventricles:
        - Tricuspid (right)
        - Bicuspid (left)
    - Semilunar => found in arteries leaving heart

Tendons (heartstrings) => prevent atrioventricular valves from turning inside out

Blood return to the heart through:
    - help of muscle contraction
    - valves in veins
    - exhalation from lungs pulls blood up

Coronary arteries => supply heart with oxygen and glucose, first detachment from aorta

Monitoring heart activity:
    - making ECG (electrocardiogram)
    - first Cuspid then semilunar on ECG

Heart attack => part of heart muscle stopped contracting

Atheroma => what blocks the arteries causes coronary heart dissease (CHD)

CHD factors:
    - Poor diet
    - Poor lifestyle
    - Genetic factors

Many take half an aspirin; small amount of red wine

If CHD is suspected an angiogram is carried out to show the state of the arteries
Surgical treatment:
    - Angioplasty => ballon
    - Stent => metal cage
    - Coronary artery bypass => blood vessel removed from another part of the body
